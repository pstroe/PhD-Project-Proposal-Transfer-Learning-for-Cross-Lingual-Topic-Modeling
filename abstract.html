<div>Nowadays, libraries spend more and more time and effort into digitising their archives. This exponential growth of digitally available resources requires new and innovative methods to provide users with tools to explore these digitised archives. However, from a computational linguistic point of view, these tools need to be tailored specifically to the text collections. This is mainly due to the vast amount of different text genres and the various needs of the users, but also due to the quality and diversity of the digitised archives. Often, techniques to explore digitised text sources must be specifically tailored to the text classes they contain. In the realm of historical newspapers, for instance, historians would expect to sort news articles according to certain topics, while a linguist might be interested into the semantic shift of words. Coincidentally, the methodologies to process these huge text collections to the liking of the different user groups overlap and sometimes even depend on each other. Hence, while this thesis sets out to carry out research on novel methods of multilingual topic modeling and finding relations between topics, it will also touch upon issues like semantic indexing, key word extraction and multi-word expressions.Abstract content goes here</div>
